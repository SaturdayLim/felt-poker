# Saturday Signature v1.0.3

The design kit for every Saturday Portfolio project: glass surfaces, fonts, colour tokens, four toggle types, caption rules and layout rules for desktop and phone. Two skins: **Saturday** (teal, Instrument Serif) and **Código** (stone and gold, Baskerville).

Start here: open `demo/index.html` in a browser. It shows every part of the kit. Use the switches at the top to change theme and skin.

## What's inside

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `demo/index.html` | Live showcase of every component, both skins, both themes |

| `css/tokens.css` | All design tokens as CSS variables (generated) |
| `css/saturday.css` | Fonts, base styles and components |
| `css/skin-codigo.css` | Código skin (generated) |

| `licenses/` | SIL Open Font License for each bundled font |

## Load the kit into a project (plain HTML, about 5 minutes)

1. Copy this whole folder into the project and rename it `saturday`.
2. Paste these lines into `<head>`, in this order:

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
   <script>try{var t=localStorage.getItem('sat-theme');if(t==='light'||t==='dark')document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme',t)}catch(e){}</script>
   <link rel="icon" href="saturday/assets/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
   <link rel="preload" href="saturday/fonts/Geist-Variable.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="saturday/css/tokens.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="saturday/css/saturday.css">
   <script src="saturday/js/saturday.js" defer></script>
   ```

   The one-line script stops a white flash on dark-mode devices. Keep it before the stylesheets.
3. Add `class="sat"` to `<body>`.
4. For Código projects, also add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="saturday/css/skin-codigo.css">` after `saturday.css`, and set `<html lang="en" data-skin="codigo">`.
5. Build the page from the classes in `demo/index.html`. Copy a block from the demo, then change the words.

### Smallest working page

```html
<body class="sat">
  <header class="sat-header sat-shell">
    <div class="sat-header-bar sat-glass">
      <div class="sat-brand"><!-- paste assets/saturday-shakes-mark.svg here and add class="sat-mark" --><span class="sat-wordmark">Saturday Shakes</span></div>
      <button class="sat-btn sat-btn--ghost sat-iconbtn" data-sat-theme-cycle aria-label="Change theme">◐</button>
    </div>
  </header>
  <main class="sat-shell sat-stack">
    <div class="sat-glass sat-stat">
      <span class="sat-caption">Active markets</span>
      <span class="sat-kpi">35</span>
      <span class="sat-delta sat-delta--up">▲ 2.9%<small>v F25 (34)</small></span>
    </div>
  </main>
</body>
```

### Theme toggle

- Three-way (desktop): a `.sat-seg` with three `role="radio"` buttons carrying `data-sat-theme="auto"`, `"light"` and `"dark"`.
- One button (phone): any button with `data-sat-theme-cycle`. It cycles auto, light, dark.
- From code: `Saturday.setTheme('dark')`. Listen for changes with `document.addEventListener('sat-theme', e => e.detail.resolved)`.
- The choice is stored in `localStorage` under `sat-theme`. Auto follows the operating system and updates live.

### Listening to toggles

Every switch, segmented control and chip fires a bubbling `sat-change` event:

```js
document.getElementById('measure').addEventListener('sat-change', e => render(e.detail.value));
```

`detail` is `{ checked }` for a switch, `{ value }` for a segmented control (the button's `data-value`), and `{ pressed }` for a chip.

## React, Next.js and Vite

1. Copy the folder to `public/saturday` (Next.js) or `src/saturday` (Vite).
2. Import the CSS once, in the root layout or `main.jsx`:
   ```js
   import './saturday/css/tokens.css';
   import './saturday/css/saturday.css';
   ```
   In Next.js with the folder in `public/`, use `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/saturday/css/...">` in the root layout's `<head>` instead.
3. Put the one-line theme script in `<head>` (Next.js: `<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "..." }} />` inside the root layout's `<head>`).
4. Add `className="sat"` to `<body>`.
5. Either load `saturday.js` (it works on any DOM, including React-rendered markup), or drive the attributes from React state: set `aria-checked` / `aria-pressed` yourself and call `window.Saturday.setTheme()` for the theme.

## Tailwind

- **v4:** in your main CSS:
  ```css
  @import "tailwindcss";
  @import "./saturday/css/tokens.css";
  @import "./saturday/tokens/tailwind-theme.css";
  ```
  Then use `bg-sat-glass-1`, `text-sat-muted`, `font-display`, `rounded-sat-lg`, `shadow-sat`. Keep `saturday.css` too if you want the ready-made components.
- **v3:** `presets: [require('./saturday/tokens/tailwind.preset.js')]` in `tailwind.config.js`, and import `tokens.css` in your CSS.

Tailwind classes point at the CSS variables, so theme and skin switching keep working.

## One-file deliverables (emailed reports, Apps Script, Worldmap-style builds)

```bash
node saturday/tools/inline-kit.js page.html page.single.html
```

This puts the kit's CSS and JS inside the page and embeds the fonts as base64. The result opens with no other files and no internet. It adds about 250 KB. For Google Apps Script, paste the output into `App.html`.

## Excel, PowerPoint and other non-web tools

Take the hex values from `tokens/tokens.json` (`skins.saturday.light` for print and slides). For slides, use `bg` as background, `text` for body, `accent-fill` for one highlight per slide, Instrument Serif for titles and Geist for text. The `.woff2` files here are for the web only; for Office, install the TTF versions from fonts.google.com, or fall back to Georgia and Segoe UI.

## Change a colour or size

1. Edit `tokens/tokens.json`.
2. Run `node tools/build-tokens.js`.
3. Run `node tools/check-contrast.js`. It must end with `All 120 checks pass.` If a check fails, darken (light theme) or lighten (dark theme) the failing colour and run it again.
4. Open `demo/index.html` in light and dark and look at the change.
5. Bump `meta.version` in `tokens.json` and add a line to the changelog below.

## Use with Claude Code

Copy this whole folder to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\saturday-signature\` (it contains `SKILL.md`). Claude Code then applies the kit when you build a page, dashboard or tool UI for a Saturday Portfolio or Código project. You can also say "use the Saturday signature" in any session.

## Browser support

Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox from 2023 onward. Browsers without `backdrop-filter` get solid panels automatically.

## Licences

The kit's own code and docs are yours. The fonts are under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (see `licenses/`): free to use, embed and ship, not to sell on their own. The Código brand fonts (Engravers, Baskerville Brand) are licensed separately and are **not** in this kit; the Código skin uses them only if they are installed on the viewer's computer.

## Changelog

- **1.0.3 (26 Oct 2026):** Saturday Shakes shaker mark added (vector, from the logo deck) with favicon, `--sat-mark` token and logo rules; financial year July to June; number format; Title Case for page titles only; accents on Código 1530 and Añejo everywhere; 120 contrast checks.
- **1.0.2 (26 Oct 2026):** period abbreviations confirmed and written as a pattern (`M-1TD`, `PFYTD`, `CYTEOM`, `N3M`, `MoM`), F = financial year, tooltip rule completed.
